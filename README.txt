Collection of exercises and their solutions developed in MATLAB for the lab component of the "Computational physics for scientists and engineers" course that I developed and presented to the students at York University in 2014. (To avoid confusion, I did not teach the lecture component of the course: the course director was Prof. Christopher Bergevin.) 

Each folder is named as "Lab week_index. lab_name", where week_index is the week (from the start of the course) at which the lab was conducted, and lab_name is, naturally, the name of this lab.

For each week, the corresponding folder contains the pdf file with the description of the laboratory for the respective week (8 labs in total) and all of the respective solutions.
